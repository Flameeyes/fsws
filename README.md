Flameeyes's Static Web Site
===========================

Welcome to my personal collection of XSLT helper templates to generate
a complete static website starting from very simple XML data files.

Unfortunately, while I was finally able to opensource this, I haven't
been able to properly set up documentation an example, but I hope to
do so in the next weeks.

Getting the sources
-------------------

If you're receiving this from a website that uses FSWS, you might
wonder which one is the main and original repository for the project.

You can find the sources on [my GitHub
repository](http://github.com/Flameeyes/fsws) and the details of my
project on [my website](http://www.flameeyes.eu/projects/fsws) (which
uses FSWS itself).

Prerequisites
-------------

Right now the templates are designed to be generic, but are only
tested with `xsltproc` as provided by
[libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/).

In the future there might be feature depending on shared object
extensions for libxslt, so that will remain the main supported
implementation.
